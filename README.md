Selectivity Study:
Use protocol to analyze change in current to Amiloride at -85 mV and (ContRamp1550) and pgf file to measure Selectivity (10 times ContRamp1550, followed by 3 times Step)

Analysis of Selectivity Data:

Enter Meta Data

-	Amplitude analysis amiloride sensitive current: Enter ContRamp1550 data of amiloride block into excel spreadsheet (only works 1 file per cell). They are located in the Box Folder: /Users/Fechner/Box Sync/Fechner/TEVC-GoodmanlabBOX/Project-STFX/MetaDataSTFX/MetaDelta and are called TEVCMetaSTFX111.xlsx â€“ replace STFX111 with the current frog number. check out Example_MetaDelta.xlsx for more information.
